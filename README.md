# Machine Learning Portfolio (in progress)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects I'm working on for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. The projects are categorized into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, and are written in Python using various machine learning libraries and tools.

## Projects

### Beginner

1. **[Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/beginner/titanic%20survival%20prediction)**: A binary classification problem where the objective is to predict the survival of passengers based on various features like age, sex, passenger class, etc. Techniques used include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building with logistic regression.

2. **[Spam Detector](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/beginner/spam%20detector)**: A text classification problem to identify whether an email is spam or not. This project includes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Naive Bayes algorithms, and model performance evaluation.

3. **[Iris Flowers Classification](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/beginner/iris%20flowers%20classification)**: A multiclass classification problem that predicts the species of Iris flowers based on certain features. Various classification algorithms were experimented with and their performances were compared.

### Intermediate

1. **[House Price Prediction](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/intermediate/house%20price%20prediction)**: A regression problem that predicts house prices based on various features. This project involves feature engineering, data preprocessing, advanced regression techniques, and model evaluation.

2. **[Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/intermediate/handwritten%20digit%20recognition)**: This project involves implementing a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

3. **[Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/intermediate/customer%20segmentation)**: This project applies unsupervised learning techniques (like K-means clustering) on a customer dataset to segment customers into different groups.

### Advanced

1. **[Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/advanced/time%20series%20forecasting)**: Predict stock prices or weather patterns using time series analysis. This complex problem involves understanding sequences and working with models like ARIMA or LSTM.

2. **[Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/advanced/sentiment%20analysis)**: Conduct sentiment analysis on movie reviews or Twitter data. This involves NLP and potentially deep learning (RNNs or Transformers).

3. **[Image Caption Generator](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/advanced/image%20caption%20generator)**: Create a model that generates captions for images. This project involves both convolutional neural networks (for image processing) and recurrent neural networks (for text generation).

4. **[Recommender System](https://github.com/dev-ro/machine-learning-projects/tree/main/advanced/recommender%20system)**: Build a movie or music recommendation system using a dataset like MovieLens. This involves learning about collaborative filtering and potentially deep learning.

Each project contains a detailed description and code explaining the techniques and strategies used. Feedback, improvements, and collaborations are always welcome!
