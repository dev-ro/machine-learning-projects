# Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. Understanding the diverse groups of customers can help companies with marketing, customer service, and product development.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Wholesale customers data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains annual spending amounts of various product categories for the clients of a wholesale distributor.

## Requirements

This project is implemented in Python, with the use of the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Conducted preliminary exploration to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalized the data and handled outliers to prepare the dataset for clustering.
3. **Model Building**: Used K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct clusters.
4. **Cluster Analysis**: Interpreted and analyzed the characteristics of each customer segment.
5. **Visualization**: Visualized the clusters using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Results

The K-means algorithm successfully segmented the customers into XX distinct groups. Detailed results and discussions can be found in the [Jupyter notebook](link-to-notebook).

## Future Work

Future plans include trying other clustering algorithms such as hierarchical and DBSCAN, and integrating this project with supervised learning models for predictive analytics.
