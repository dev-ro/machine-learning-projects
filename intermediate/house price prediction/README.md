# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented a machine learning model to predict house prices. This is a classic regression problem where various features such as the number of rooms, location, and house age are used to predict a continuous target variable, the house price.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, MA.

## Requirements

This project is implemented in Python, with the use of the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Explored the dataset to understand the data's structure and various attributes.
2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleaned the data, handled missing values, outliers, and engineered new features to better represent the problem at hand.
3. **Model Building**: Built a variety of models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regressor, and compared their performances.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models based on metrics appropriate for regression such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
5. **Model Optimization**: Tuned the hyperparameters of the best-performing model to optimize its performance.

## Results

The final model achieved an R-squared of XX% on the test set. More detailed results and discussions can be found in the [Jupyter notebook](link-to-notebook).

## Future Work

In the future, I plan to explore more complex models and feature selection techniques to further improve the model's performance.
