# Iris Flowers Classification

## Project Overview

This project involves the application of various machine learning models to classify the species of Iris flowers. It is a multiclass classification problem, a fundamental concept in machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the well-known [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species.

## Requirements

This project is implemented in Python, with the use of the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: The structure of the dataset was analyzed, and key characteristics of the different iris species were identified.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was split into a training set and a test set. Feature scaling was applied to the predictors.
3. **Model Building**: Several machine learning models were implemented, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The models' performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. A confusion matrix was also constructed for each model.
5. **Model Optimization**: The hyperparameters of the best-performing model were tuned to optimize its performance.

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. More detailed results and discussions can be found in the [Jupyter notebook](link-to-notebook).

## Future Work

Future improvements will include the exploration of ensemble methods and more complex models to improve performance.
