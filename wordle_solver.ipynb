    "# Wordle Game Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides an automatic solver for the game Wordle. It takes user feedback about each guess (character and position feedback) and progressively narrows down the set of possible words until it finds the correct word.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reverse_filter(words, guess)`: Filters the set of possible words based on the user's feedback for each character of a guess.\n",
    "- `recommend(words)`: Recommends a word to guess. It prioritizes words with unique characters for the first three guesses.\n",
    "- `get_guess()`: Prompts the user to enter their guess and the corresponding feedback.\n",
    "- `keep_playing(choice)`: Checks if the user wants to continue playing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver continues refining its list of possible words and making recommendations until the user chooses to stop playing or the correct word is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial list of words is generated from a large English dictionary and filters down to only include 5-letter words. This could be further optimized by using a dictionary subset specific to the game Wordle, if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the current approach isn't perfectly optimized, it still provides a powerful tool for automating the game of Wordle and showcasing the potential of artificial intelligence in solving word-based puzzles.\n"

    "# Improving the Word Guessing Game Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several key aspects of our current word guessing strategy that could potentially be improved. The following discussion points could form the basis for further investigation and optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting Word Choice\n",
    "- Our current approach uses 'adieu' as the first word in every game. This decision seems arbitrary and could potentially be optimized. Two possible alternative strategies come to mind:\n",
    "    - We could select the word that minimizes the size of the possible word set after the first guess. This would aim to remove as many non-matching words as possible right at the start.\n",
    "    - Alternatively, we could use a Monte Carlo simulation to select the word that, on average, leads to finding the correct word in the fewest guesses. This approach would consider longer-term outcomes rather than just the immediate impact of the first guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distinct Character Word Selection\n",
    "- Currently, we randomly choose words with distinct characters for the second and third guesses. While this strategy likely improves the efficiency of our guessing, it's unclear whether this is the best possible approach. An exploration of alternative word selection methods could be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling of Words with Repeated Characters\n",
    "- Our current approach treats words with repeated characters (like 'daddy') as less likely and leaves them as a lower priority in the selection process. While this approach may generally work well, there may be situations where it leads us astray. For example, if the answer does have repeated characters, our strategy could unnecessarily prolong the game. It could be worthwhile to explore how we can handle words with repeated characters more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improved Guess Optimization\n",
    "- Is there a more efficient way to optimize our guesses, especially after we have collected some feedback on our previous guesses? We currently rely on random selection from the remaining word set, but perhaps there's a more systematic approach that could be more effective. For example, could we implement a strategy that removes more words per guess without relying on previous feedback?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to these questions aren't immediately apparent and would require a more in-depth analysis and testing. It would be interesting to explore these potential areas for improvement to see how much they could enhance our game strategy.\n"
